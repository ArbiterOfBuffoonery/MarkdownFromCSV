# Markdown from CSV README

This extension creates a Markdown table from a sequence of lines in the comma delimited value (CSV) or tab delimited value (TSV) format.

The core functionality of this extension utilizes the [CsvToMarkdownTable project](https://github.com/donatj/CsvToMarkdownTable). The source code therein was modified to work cleanly with VS Code.
